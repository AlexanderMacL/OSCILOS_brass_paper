	abstract = {In this article, interleaved finite difference time domain methods are developed for the purpose of simulating the dynamics of the acoustic bore, using, as a starting point, an impedance formulation of wave propagation in an acoustic tube; attention is focused here on modeling of viscothermal and radiation losses in the time domain. In particular, in contrast to other methods, the bore, including the mouth-piece and bell, is treated as a unit, and is not subdivided into smaller units such as cylindrical or conical segments. Numerical simulations of input impedances are then compared with measurement for a variety of brass instruments.},
